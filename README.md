# Fake-News-Detection

This project focuses on developing a text classification model for news articles, categorizing them as reliable or unreliable. 
The key components include:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
In-depth analysis of the dataset using visualization tools.
Data Pre-processing:
Cleaning and handling missing values.
Implementing stemming and converting textual data into numerical features.
Model Building:
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Implementing and evaluating various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes).
Using TF-IDF vectorization for text data representation.
Model Comparison:
Evaluating model performance through metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and cross-validation scores.
